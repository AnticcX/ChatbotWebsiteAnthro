This project is a web-based cultural chatbot designed to engage users in educational and meaningful conversations with persona-based guides representing various Indigenous communities. The primary goal is to create an immersive learning experience that introduces users to diverse traditions, beliefs, and stories from cultures such as the Ju’hoansi (San), Zapotec, Yanomami, Ainu, and Enawene Nawe. By interacting with these guides through a natural chat interface, users can explore cultural perspectives in an accessible and interactive format. The application is built using FastAPI for the backend framework, leveraging its speed and asynchronous capabilities. The frontend is structured with modular HTML templates using Jinja2 and enhanced through organized external CSS and JavaScript files. The visual design follows a clean, modern aesthetic, emphasizing readability and accessibility. Dark mode support is implemented to improve user comfort and reduce eye strain, with theme preferences stored locally to preserve settings across visits. One of the defining features of the chatbot is the dynamic selection of personas from a homepage interface. Each persona is represented with a custom avatar and name, and users can choose one to begin a conversation. The chat page itself features a clean layout, including scrollable message history, timestamped entries, and the ability to toggle between English translations and the persona's original phrasing for cultural authenticity. User messages and chatbot replies are displayed in styled message bubbles, and interactions are time-stamped for context. User sessions are handled uniquely by assigning a randomly generated UUID stored in the browser’s local storage. This UUID is used to save and retrieve each user's conversation history from the server, which enables users to maintain ongoing dialogues with their selected cultural guide. Chat histories are stored as JSON files in a user-specific directory, which allows the application to provide continuity and preserve past exchanges. This feature adds depth to the interaction and encourages users to return for future exploration. On the backend, the application includes a Model class that encapsulates logic for managing conversations, loading persona prompts from text files, and handling message exchange workflows. The application reads from localized persona prompt files that guide the tone and cultural focus of the chatbot responses. To improve performance and avoid unnecessary file access, conversations are capped at a reasonable length to ensure only the most recent exchanges are kept in memory. The JavaScript components of the application manage form submissions, dynamic chat rendering, message animation, theme toggling, and auto-scrolling. These scripts ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. Chat bubbles fade in with each new message, and loading indicators provide visual feedback while waiting for replies. The interface also includes a tooltip system on the homepage to provide users with more context about each cultural guide when hovering over persona cards. Overall, this project brings together thoughtful design, structured data handling, and responsive interaction to promote cultural learning in a respectful and engaging way. It demonstrates a balanced approach to technical implementation and educational purpose. Through careful attention to user experience, modularity, and visual design, the application stands as a meaningful tool for promoting cross-cultural understanding.
